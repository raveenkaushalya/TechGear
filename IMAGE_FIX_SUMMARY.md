# TechGear Image Path Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Images were not showing in both frontend and backend because of inconsistent relative paths.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Path Updates
- **Updated all existing product images** from `src/assets/images/` to `../assets/images/`
- This ensures frontend pages (in `src/pages/`) can access images correctly

### 2. Admin Interface Image Display
- **Added `getImagePath()` helper function** in product-manager.php
- Handles multiple path formats:
  - `../assets/images/` (correct for admin)
  - `../uploads/` (for new uploaded files)
  - Legacy path conversions
- **Updated `renderTable()` function** to use proper image paths
- Added fallback "No image" text for missing images

### 3. Frontend Image Handling
- **Enhanced `createProductCard()` in app.js** with path normalization
- **Updated categories.php** product rendering with proper path handling
- Added `onerror` fallback to placeholder images
- Handles both assets and uploads directories

### 4. Image Upload Path Fix
- **Modified `handle_image_upload()` in API** to return `../uploads/` paths
- Ensures new uploaded images work correctly with frontend pages

### 5. Path Resolution Logic

| Location | Assets Path | Uploads Path | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Frontend Pages (`src/pages/`) | `../assets/images/` | `../uploads/` | Database stores these paths |
| Admin Interface (`src/admin/`) | `../assets/images/` | `../uploads/` | Same level as pages |
| Test Page (root) | `src/assets/images/` | `uploads/` | Converted automatically |

## File Changes Made

1. **Database**: Updated all image paths to use relative format
2. **src/admin/product-manager.php**: Added image path helper function
3. **src/admin/api/products.php**: Fixed upload path generation
4. **src/assets/js/app.js**: Enhanced image path handling in product cards
5. **src/pages/categories.php**: Added path normalization for category products

## Result
- ✅ Frontend images now display correctly
- ✅ Admin interface shows product thumbnails
- ✅ New uploaded images work properly
- ✅ Fallback handling for missing images
- ✅ Consistent path handling across all locations

## Testing
All pages should now display images correctly:
- http://localhost/TechGear/src/pages/index.php
- http://localhost/TechGear/src/pages/categories.php
- http://localhost/TechGear/src/admin/product-manager.php
- http://localhost/TechGear/test-products.html
