# TechGear Shopping App

A responsive e-commerce shopping application for tech products built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Organization

This project has been reorganized into a more structured format. All the application code is now located in the `src` directory.

```
ShoppingAPP/
├── src/              # Source code directory containing all application files
│   ├── assets/       # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
│   ├── components/   # Reusable HTML components
│   └── pages/        # Application pages with the main index.html
└── index.html        # Root redirect to src/pages/index.html
```
## How to Run

The application can be run by serving the project with a web server like XAMPP and accessing it through a browser:

1. Ensure the project is in your web server's root directory (e.g., \xampp/htdocs/\)
2. Start your web server
3. Navigate to \http://localhost/ShoppingAPP/\ in your browser
4. You will be automatically redirected to the main application page in src/pages/index.html
